**Paper's abstract:**
Using Twitter analytics, this paper explored the relationship between political involvement
and the bimodality of political attitudes. From the Cusp Catastrophe model of attitudes, it was
expected that higher political involvement would make the bimodality of political attitudes
more extreme. Using natural language processing, political attitudes and political involvement
of 921 Twitter users were estimated. A partial Cusp Catastrophe model was fitted to test the
prediction. The analysis results did not support the prediction but some methodological
insights are provided: measuring attitudes per user averages out extreme opinions,
measurements of political involvement and attitudes must consider the same topic, and
organizations and bots have to be identified and removed from the data. Finally,
opportunities and challenges of Twitter analytics are explored and discussed.
